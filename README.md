# Binary Classification Challenge

## ML Problem Definition
This is a **Binary Classification** problem using structured tabular data (`.csv`).  
The goal is to predict the outcome of matches based on player statistics.

## Description
Participants are tasked with predicting outcomes in a competitive match setting.  
The dataset contains player-level statistics (Radiant vs Dire teams) recorded during gameplay.  

---

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric is **ROC AUC**.  

- ROC AUC measures the ability of a classifier to distinguish between two classes.  
- A perfect model will have an ROC AUC of **1.0**, while a random model will score around **0.5**.

## Dataset Description

### File Descriptions
- **`train_data.csv`** â€“ training dataset  
- **`test_data.csv`** â€“ testing dataset  

### Data Fields
Player statistics are prefixed to indicate **team** and **player number**:
- `r` â†’ Radiant team  
- `d` â†’ Dire team  

Each player has the following fields:

- **hero_id** â€“ unique hero identifier  
- **K/D/A** â€“ kills, deaths, assists  
- **lh** â€“ last hits (enemy creeps killed)  
- **denies** â€“ allied creeps killed to deny gold  
- **gold** â€“ current gold  
- **xp** â€“ experience points  
- **level** â€“ player level  
- **health / max_health** â€“ current and maximum health  
- **max_mana** â€“ maximum mana capacity  
- **x, y** â€“ map coordinates (player location)  
- **stuns** â€“ total stun duration caused  
- **creeps_stacked** â€“ number of neutral creeps stacked  
- **camps_stacked** â€“ number of camps stacked  
- **rune_pickups** â€“ number of runes picked up  
- **firstblood_claimed** â€“ whether the player claimed first blood  
- **teamfight_participation** â€“ participation ratio in team fights  
- **towers_killed** â€“ towers destroyed  
- **roshans_killed** â€“ roshan kills  
- **obs_placed** / **sen_placed** â€“ observer and sentry wards placed  

### Time Series Fields
Some statistics are provided as time series:

- **`times`** â€“ array of time marks  
- **gold_t** â€“ gold values at time marks  
- **xp_t** â€“ experience at time marks  
- **lh_t** â€“ last hits  
- **dn_t** â€“ denied creeps

## Goal
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Train binary classification models  
- Evaluate models using ROC AUC  
- Explore time series features for additional predictive power
